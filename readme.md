## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tham1G/DataJobs-Platform.git
cd DataJobs-Platform
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

```bash
cd API
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST=your_server
DB_NAME=datajobs
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Run the backend:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

API available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```
